# Mindo-AI
Exploring InfoFi with Mindo AI — measuring real influence through social + on-chain data.
# 🌐 Mindo AI  

Mindo AI is building the **InfoFi meta**: a new way to measure and reward real influence in Web3.  
No more fake followers or vanity metrics — Mindo AI blends **social signals** with **on-chain actions** to quantify authentic impact.  

## ✨ What is Mindo AI?  
Mindo AI is a Web3-native platform that tracks and scores influence by combining:  
- 📊 Social activity (engagement, conversions, interactions)  
- 🔗 On-chain behavior (swaps, staking, DAO votes, etc.)  

This creates a transparent and verifiable measure of influence that benefits both **creators** and **projects**.  

## 🎯 Who is it for?  
- **Creators** → Gain fair recognition for your true impact.  
- **Projects** → Identify KOLs who actually drive ROI instead of wasting budget on inflated numbers.  

## 🚀 Vision  
Mindo AI turns **attention into capital**.  
The goal: become the engine that transforms engagement, trust, and belief into measurable value for the entire Web3 ecosystem.
